# 📘 C++ & DSA Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning **C++ from the ground up**, gradually progressing into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

The goal of this repo is not to showcase polished projects, but to **build strong fundamentals**, write code consistently, and understand *how and why things work*.

---

## 🚀 Why this Repository?

- To learn C++ **properly**, not just syntax
- To understand **memory, pointers, STL, and logic building**
- To transition smoothly from **basic programming → DSA**
- To maintain a structured and honest learning record

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> *“I don’t aim to memorize solutions — I aim to understand the problem.”*

This repository focuses on:
- Writing simple, readable code
- Revisiting concepts until they make sense
- Learning through mistakes and fixes
- Building intuition before optimization

---

---

## 📈 Progress Style

- Concept-wise folders
- Small focused programs
- No unnecessary boilerplate
- Each file targets **one idea only**

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository reflects my **learning phase**.
- Code may be unoptimized in places
- Multiple approaches may exist for the same problem
- Improvements will happen over time

That’s intentional.

---

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Add problem-wise explanations
- Improve time & space complexity
- Solve standard DSA problem sets
- Transition to competitive programming patterns

## 🤝 Contributions & Feedback

This is a personal learning repository,  
but **constructive feedback is always welcome**.
